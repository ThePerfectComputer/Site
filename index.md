# Current Work

Currently building [FastWave](https://github.com/ThePerfectComputer/FastWave), a VCD parser written in Rust intended to be the backend of a digital logic Waveform Viewer(built in [egui](https://www.egui.rs)). The waveform veiwer will support dynmically loading Rust code for analysis of loaded waveforms.
